Rearm Scripts for Windows and Office
===================================

Scripts used to reactivate Windows and/or Office after the evaluation period has ended.

The evaluation period can be reset twice for each product, so these scripts auto-delete themselves after execution as a way of keeping track of how many times the evaluation has been reactivated.

1. Install Windows/Office evaluation on a virtual machine.
2. Copy the Rearm folder to the desktop.
3. When the evaluation period ends, right-click the first rearm script and **Run as Administrator**.
4. Reboot to restart the evaluation period.
5. Reboot again, if needed, to reset the evaluation period text shown on the Windows desktop.
