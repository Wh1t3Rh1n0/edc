***Scripts that come in handy every day.***

---

## What these do

- Display time and date stamp in terminal windows. Portable shortcuts to make this portable, and install scripts included to make this permanent.
    - The `install_prompt_bash.sh` script also adds a few customizations for other commands.
- Enhance colors, fonts, and sizes of cmd.exe and powershell.exe for clear screenshots (portable versions only).
- Shortcuts to prevent screen from locking.
- Batch file to run the white command prompt when it's blocked by Group Policy.
- Miscellaneous scripts that come in handy for setting up Windows virtual machines.


## Notes on use

- Portable files need to be renamed after download to make them work. Just change the `-` to a `.`.


## Notes on the "Don't Lock Screen" variants

- **Vol-+** - Quickly press volume down and then volume up. Causes a pop-up, but not as intrusive as NumLock (such as when switching between host and virtual machines).
- **Insert X2** - Presses Insert two times in rapid succession.
	- Potential issue: If you're pressing/holding Shift when this triggers, you're clipboard contents will get pasted. Not ideal. üòù
- **Shift** - Presses Shift once every 290 seconds.
	- Potential issue: Windows dings every time Shift is pressed from a minimized window. It seems to happen when the window is hidden on other desktops too.
- **NumLock X2** - This is the original method, and it works well *except* on the latest versions of Windows where a pop-up box gets displayed every time NumLock is turned on/off. That was getting in the way of my screenshots when I'd switch between virtual machines, so I tried some alternatives.
