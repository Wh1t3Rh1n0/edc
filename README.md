***Scripts that come in handy every day.***

---

## What these do

- Display time and date stamp in terminal windows. Portable shortcuts to make this portable, and install scripts included to make this permanent.
- Enhance colors, fonts, and sizes of cmd.exe and powershell.exe for clear screenshots (portable versions only).
- Shortcut to prevent screen from locking.
- Batch file to run the white command prompt when it's blocked by Group Policy.

## Notes on use

- Portable files need to be renamed after download to make them work. Just change the `-` to a `.`.
